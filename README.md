This project aims to develop a comprehensive web application that addresses the challenges of managing and monitoring research, intellectual property rights (IPR), innovation developments, and start-up growth in Gujarat. Currently, these activities are managed through fragmented systems, leading to inefficiencies in data accessibility, transparency, and resource allocation.

The proposed web application will act as a centralized platform, integrating key functions such as a unified data repository, transparent monitoring tools, streamlined IPR management, and support services for innovators and entrepreneurs. It will enable efficient resource allocation through real-time data insights and provide collaboration tools to foster a cohesive ecosystem among researchers, policymakers, investors, and other stakeholders.

By centralizing data, enhancing transparency, and improving resource utilization, the platform is expected to accelerate innovation, increase start-up success rates, and contribute to Gujarat's overall economic growth.
